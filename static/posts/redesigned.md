wxllow.dev has, for the third time, been redesigned/remade :)

As you may have noticed, I have redesigned my website from Scratch.
There wasn't much wrong with the site previously, I just wanted to redesign it for fun and to get experience with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), which now powers this site :)

On my previous site, I was just using simple.css and some minimal custom CSS, but this time I wanted to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to have more control over the styling.
